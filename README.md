Analysis of North American Flight Data 

The aim of this project is to take a ‘dirty’ dataset that would otherwise not be useful in the data analysis process and convert it into an actionable dataset that can be used to derive insightful information. We decided that this insightful information in our case would be meaningful visualizations that would help us identify key properties of objects in the dataset. For this purpose, we looked at several datasets online and zeroed down on the Flights dataset that was available on Kaggle (https://kaggle.com/mmetter/flights).

We used Python and OpenRefine to clean the data.

The Dataset was then converted to database using PostgreSQL and pgAdmin 4. Since the aim of this project was to clean the data and not to create a model, the main table wasn't broken down into subtables but views were created to obtain general information about the dataset.

The dataset was also visualized using Spotfire.
